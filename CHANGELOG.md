# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); while it is in `0.x`, a minor version may change the API.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GitHub workflows: tests with the race detector, a build for linux and darwin on amd64 and arm64, golangci-lint,
  CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, gitleaks, and releases with GoReleaser on version tags.
- A Makefile with the developer targets (`build`, `test`, `test-race`, `lint`, `fmt`, `vet`, `cover`, `cross`,
  `clean`), an `.editorconfig` and a golangci-lint configuration the code passes.
- Documentation in `docs/`: getting started, architecture, slices and configuration; a code of conduct, issue and
  pull request templates, CODEOWNERS and Dependabot.
- Brand assets: wordmarks for light and dark backgrounds, a square avatar and the social preview.
- `tools/publish-tree.sh` exports one commit as a fresh single-commit repository, refusing when it finds a forbidden
  word or a secret.
- A gitleaks configuration with narrow allowlists for test fixtures.

### Changed

- The README is rewritten around a quick start that runs the runtime standalone; the configuration tables and the
  slice details moved to `docs/`.
- Golden test data stores fake provider credentials as placeholders built at run time.

### Fixed

- Stopping the design library's server also stops its background history and waits for a snapshot under way.
- A pane command a page applied before the runtime started waiting for it is reported as applied.
- Tests no longer depend on the machine's umask, wait for the standalone run's panes to exit, and the timeline golden
  scenario waits for events instead of time.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-19

The first version that runs a machine without the previous runtime. 0.1.0 to 0.8.0 were internal pre-releases that
built up to it; this entry summarises everything the project holds.

### Added

- **Machine agent** (`cmd/agent`): one process per Unix account with a single WebSocket link to the cluster (wire
  protocol v1), serving the agents' transcripts with change events, the runtime's state files with versioned writes,
  the status and sync sockets relayed, TCP tunnels to the runtime and the disk service, and token-guarded loopback
  routes. `cmd/agentprobe` drives an agent the way the cluster does, for compatibility diffs and benchmarks.
- **Runtime gate** (`cmd/runtime`): holds the runtime's port and answers the slices switched on per machine in
  `state-mode.json`, re-read every second; hands everything else, sockets included, to the previous runtime over
  pooled connections; runs read-only slices in shadow and logs where the answers differ; records traffic and logs
  per-path proxy statistics.
- **Standalone mode**: with no previous runtime the gate is the whole runtime and does its start-up work itself: the
  single-instance lock, the config and shared secret, the `cli-token`, the hook, status line and Codex hook scripts,
  the agents' settings and MCP files, the prompt editor and the Codex launcher.
- **Core**: the tab state keeper fed by hooks, transcripts, screens and the process tree; the layout and workspace
  stores; the status and sync sockets; the prompt queue and delivery into tmux panes; hook routes; web push; idle sleep
  of agents; plugin and skill reloads in idle Claude tabs.
- **tmux control layer** and parsers of the agents' terminal screens; the terminal socket as a pty on `tmux attach`.
- **Claude Code and Codex support**: detection in a pane, launch and resume lines, the process table, background work,
  subscription limits with a forecast, session history and statistics.
- **Slices** of the previous runtime's routes in Go: `fsread` (machine and file reads, git answers, slash commands,
  launch choices), `fswrite` (uploads, editor saves, repository sync), `machines` (machine snapshot, load, health),
  `launch` (conversations, automation and eval runs, side chats), `transcripts` (links, message counts, usage report,
  statistics, conversation snapshots), `timeline` (conversation socket, status line sink, economics, subagents, turn
  checkpoints), `design` (design library with its server, history, imports and headless checks), `preview` (reverse
  proxy with DevTools and an MCP server), `services` (GitLab, link previews, tracker cards, site icons), `voice`
  (dictation) and `state` (settings files, automations and the remaining routes).
- Byte-for-byte compatible answers (status codes, JSON key order, headers, ETags) pinned by golden tests recorded from
  the previous implementation's handlers.
